# Justus Grant: Smartwyre Developer Interview
üòÖ Thank you for considering me for this position. I completed this assignment using Visual Studio for Mac - so I apologize if Windows users experience weird/inconsistent behavior. I hope my work here is satisfactory and look forward to having the pleasure of joining the Smartwyre Team. - Justus Solomon Grant

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I've introduced Dependency Injection and refactored this project to use DI.
   
3. I wrote unit tests for each of the 3 Incentive Types testing both success and failure cases.

3. I refactored the rebate service to use rebate & product to determine an initial success status. I've left the switch statement checking the rebate's IncentiveType so that the unique business logic associated with each incentive type can be preserved. It would be possible to create private methods to handle the IncentiveType-specific business logic. One could also create a factory to handle calculating the rebate amount & final success status. I felt that both of those approaches would be slightly over-engineering the solution to this interview problem - but would have made these suggestions in a non-interview setting.

4. I renamed the "Types" namespace to "Models" to be more consistent with conventional naming practices. 

5. I used Moq and NUnit to write the unit tests instead of using XUnit. üôèüèø  Please don't take points away for this. It was intentional and a result of my own personal preference. I am still following the 3 A's of unit testing (Arrange, Act, Assert)

6. All services and data stores are referenced by their interfaces instead of being directly referenced.

7. No longer creating new instances of the data stores inappropriately.

** I recognize the Decimal.Parse() method in Program.cs (line 36) can throw an error on invalid input. In a production app, I would use TryParse or another means of protecting against invalid input.

** I would also suggest adding the calculated rebate amount to the response object so that it can be reported directly back to the user.
